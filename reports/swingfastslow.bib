	abstract = {Volleyball coaches are frequently forced to address the question of athlete service errors as a part of their overall service strategy. This is usually done in an ad hoc fashion with an arbitrarily selected maximum allowable service error fraction or maximum allowable service error-to-ace ratio. In this article, an analysis of service outcomes leads to a mathematical expression for the point-scoring fraction in terms of service ace fraction, service error fraction, and opponent modified sideout fraction. These parameters are assumed to be monotonic functions of an athlete or team’s serving aggressiveness and a linear model for the service error-to-ace ratio is used to close the point-scoring optimization problem. The model provides estimates of the optimal service error fraction for individual athletes based on their service ace fraction and the opponent modified sideout fraction against the server overall and also when restricted to only serves that led to perfect passes. Case studies of the Bay to Bay 17 Black Boys’ USAV Juniors team and the Brigham Young University Men’s NCAA Division I team are used to demonstrate the application of the model and standard errors for the predicted optimal service error fractions are calculated with bootstrap resampling.},

Quality is expressed as a function of various covariates including pitch count, pitch location, pitch type, and pitch speed. The estimation of the pitch quality is obtained through the use of random forest methodology to accommodate the inherent complexity of the relationship between pitch quality and the associated covariates. With the fitted model, various applications are considered which provide new insights on pitching and batting.},

	abstract = {What is the optimal rate of passing in professional football? We derive a simple model of playcalling efficiency in the NFL. Efficiency is highest when the play comes as a surprise and falls when a more expected play is called. That is, playcalling efficiency is determined by a usage curve. We use an instrumental variables strategy to identify these usage curves on early downs---estimating the effect of passing, expected passing, and their interaction on per-play efficiency. We propose two new instruments, the first of which is based on fumbles lost. More specifically, we argue that conditional on total cumulative fumbles by each team, cumulative fumbles lost serves as a valid instrument in each of these cases. The second exploits documented negative autocorrelation in playcalling: the play after a pass tends to be a rush, and vice versa. Using 15 years of play-by-play data, we use this strategy to estimate linear usage curves, from which we recover the optimal early-down passing rate. On first and second down, coaches have their quarterbacks drop back to pass about 51.7\% of the time, whereas the optimal rate is around 59.1\%. These results imply coaches deviate from the optimal pass rate, overestimating the value of surprise.},

	abstract = {In baseball and softball, batted-ball velocities depend strongly on bat speed prior to contact. The purpose of this study was to characterize the sensitivity of hit. ball speed to swing speed models. A pitching machine was used to project balls at varying speeds considered to be age appropriate for female fastpitch softball batters ranging from 9 to 24 years of age. Participants swung bats of varying moment of inertia and high-speed video was used to measure bat and ball kinematics for each hit. Several power law swing speed models were compared, including a generic model for all participants, age-specific models and participant-specific models. In addition, an exponential Gaussian process regression model was used. Estimates of batted-ball speeds were obtained by coupling the swing speed models to a model of the bat–ball collision. The root mean square error of model estimates ranged from 2.3 to 5.0 rad/s for swing speed models and 3.6 to 8.5 m/s for batted-ball speed estimates. The Gaussian process regression model performance was similar to the participant-specific models (swing speed root mean square error = 2.4 rad/s; batted-ball speed root mean square error = 3.7 m/s). The correlation of the Gaussian process regression model with field measurements was surprising given the limited number of inputs, which warrants further investigation. Agreement between all power law models and field measurements improved when the bat moment of inertia about its instantaneous center of rotation (rather than about the knob) was considered. This information will be of use to players and coaches to improve batting performance and bat selection.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine which biomechanical variables measured during the baseball swing are associated with linear bat speed at ball contact (bat speed). Twenty collegiate baseball players hit a baseball from a tee into a net. Kinematics were recorded with a motion capture system sampling at 500 Hz and kinetics were measured by force plates under each foot sampling at 1000 Hz. Associations between bat speed, individual joint and segment kinematics, joint moments and ground reaction forces (GRF) were assessed using Pearson correlations and stepwise linear regression. Average bat speed was 30 ± 2 m/s. Lead foot peak vertical (159 ± 29\% BW, r = 0.622, P = 0.001), posterior (−57 ± 12\% BW, r = –0.574, P = 0.008) and resultant (170 ± 30\% BW, r = 0.662, P = 0.001) GRF were all correlated with bat speed. No combination of factors strengthened the relationship to bat speed beyond these individual variables. These results illustrate the role of the lead leg in generating and transferring ground reaction forces through the kinetic chain in order to accelerate the bat. Training to improve bat speed should include both general lower extremity strengthening exercises and sport-specific hitting drills to improve lower extremity force production following lead foot contact.},

It defines and contrasts three methods of selecting IVs: auxiliary instrumental variable, model implied instrumental variable, and randomized instrumental variable. It provides overidentification tests and weak IV diagnostics as methods to evaluate the quality of IVs. I review the use of IVs in models that assume heterogeneous causal effects. Another section summarizes the use of IVs in contemporary sociological publications. The conclusion suggests ways to improve the use of IVs and suggests that there are many areas in which IVs could be profitably used in sociological research.},

By coupling the flexible bat to the ball via a parametrized force that each mutually exerts on the other, a complete description of the collision process is obtained, including the exit speed of the ball vf. It is shown that vibrations play an important role in determining vf. The model is in excellent agreement with experimental data at low impact velocities. At the higher velocities more appropriate to the game of baseball, vf is shown to coincide with the rigid-body value only over a very small region in the barrel of the bat and to drop off sharply for impacts removed from that region. Some interesting insights into the collision process are obtained, including the observation that for impacts in the barrel of the bat, the momentum transferred to the ball is essentially complete by the time the elastic wave first arrives at the handle and that any clamping action of the hands will affect the bat at the impact point only after the ball and bat have separated. This suggests that vf is independent of the size, shape, and method of support of the bat at distances far from the impact location.},
