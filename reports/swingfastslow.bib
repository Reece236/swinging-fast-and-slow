	abstract = {This article is a statistical investigation into the 2017 Major League Baseball scandal involving the Houston Astros, the World Series championship winner that the same year. The Astros were alleged to have stolen their opponents’ pitching signs in order to provide their batters with a potentially unfair advantage. This work finds compelling evidence that the Astros on-field performance was significantly affected by their sign-stealing ploy and quantifies the effects. The three main findings in the article are (i) the Astros’ odds of swinging at a pitch were reduced by approximately 27\% (OR: 0.725, 95\% CI: (0.618, 0.850)) when the sign was stolen, (ii) when an Astros player swung, the odds of making contact with the ball increased roughly 80\% (OR: 1.805, 95\% CI: (1.342, 2.675)) on non-fastball pitches, and (iii) when the Astros made contact with a ball on a pitch in which the sign was known, the ball’s exit velocity (launch speed) increased on average by 2.386 (95\% CI: (0.334, 4.451)) miles per hour.},

	abstract = {The Bayesian approach to data analysis provides a powerful way to handle uncertainty in all observations, model parameters, and model structure using probability theory. Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

While several R packages have been developed that implement IRT models, they tend to be restricted to respective pre-specified classes of models.

I demonstrate how to use the R package brms together with the probabilistic programming language Stan to specify and fit a wide range of Bayesian IRT models using flexible and intuitive multilevel formula syntax. Further, item and person parameters can be related in both a linear or non-linear manner. Various distributions for categorical, ordinal, and continuous responses are supported. Users may even define their own custom response distribution for use in the presented framework. Common IRT model classes that can be specified natively in the presented framework include 1PL and 2PL logistic models optionally also containing guessing parameters, graded response and partial credit ordinal models, as well as drift diffusion models of response times coupled with binary decisions. Posterior distributions of item and person parameters can be conveniently extracted and postprocessed. Model fit can be evaluated and compared using Bayes factors and efficient cross-validation procedures.},

	abstract = {A model is developed for the collision between the baseball and bat, taking into account the transverse bending vibrations of the bat. By coupling the flexible bat to the ball via a parametrized force that each mutually exerts on the other, a complete description of the collision process is obtained, including the exit speed of the ball vf. It is shown that vibrations play an important role in determining vf. The model is in excellent agreement with experimental data at low impact velocities. At the higher velocities more appropriate to the game of baseball, vf is shown to coincide with the rigid-body value only over a very small region in the barrel of the bat and to drop off sharply for impacts removed from that region. Some interesting insights into the collision process are obtained, including the observation that for impacts in the barrel of the bat, the momentum transferred to the ball is essentially complete by the time the elastic wave first arrives at the handle and that any clamping action of the hands will affect the bat at the impact point only after the ball and bat have separated. This suggests that vf is independent of the size, shape, and method of support of the bat at distances far from the impact location.},

In this article, an analysis of service outcomes leads to a mathematical expression for the point-scoring fraction in terms of service ace fraction, service error fraction, and opponent modified sideout fraction. These parameters are assumed to be monotonic functions of an athlete or team’s serving aggressiveness and a linear model for the service error-to-ace ratio is used to close the point-scoring optimization problem. The model provides estimates of the optimal service error fraction for individual athletes based on their service ace fraction and the opponent modified sideout fraction against the server overall and also when restricted to only serves that led to perfect passes. Case studies of the Bay to Bay 17 Black Boys’ USAV Juniors team and the Brigham Young University Men’s NCAA Division I team are used to demonstrate the application of the model and standard errors for the predicted optimal service error fractions are calculated with bootstrap resampling.},

	abstract = {What is the optimal rate of passing in professional football? We derive a simple model of playcalling efficiency in the NFL. Efficiency is highest when the play comes as a surprise and falls when a more expected play is called. That is, playcalling efficiency is determined by a usage curve. We use an instrumental variables strategy to identify these usage curves on early downs---estimating the effect of passing, expected passing, and their interaction on per-play efficiency. We propose two new instruments, the first of which is based on fumbles lost. More specifically, we argue that conditional on total cumulative fumbles by each team, cumulative fumbles lost serves as a valid instrument in each of these cases. The second exploits documented negative autocorrelation in playcalling: the play after a pass tends to be a rush, and vice versa. Using 15 years of play-by-play data, we use this strategy to estimate linear usage curves, from which we recover the optimal early-down passing rate. On first and second down, coaches have their quarterbacks drop back to pass about 51.7\% of the time, whereas the optimal rate is around 59.1\%.

	abstract = {In baseball and softball, batted-ball velocities depend strongly on bat speed prior to contact. The purpose of this study was to characterize the sensitivity of hit. ball speed to swing speed models. A pitching machine was used to project balls at varying speeds considered to be age appropriate for female fastpitch softball batters ranging from 9 to 24 years of age. Participants swung bats of varying moment of inertia and high-speed video was used to measure bat and ball kinematics for each hit. Several power law swing speed models were compared, including a generic model for all participants, age-specific models and participant-specific models. In addition, an exponential Gaussian process regression model was used. Estimates of batted-ball speeds were obtained by coupling the swing speed models to a model of the bat–ball collision. The root mean square error of model estimates ranged from 2.3 to 5.0 rad/s for swing speed models and 3.6 to 8.5 m/s for batted-ball speed estimates. The Gaussian process regression model performance was similar to the participant-specific models (swing speed root mean square error = 2.4 rad/s; batted-ball speed root mean square error = 3.7 m/s). The correlation of the Gaussian process regression model with field measurements was surprising given the limited number of inputs, which warrants further investigation. Agreement between all power law models and field measurements improved when the bat moment of inertia about its instantaneous center of rotation (rather than about the knob) was considered. This information will be of use to players and coaches to improve batting performance and bat selection.},

	doi = {10.1080/14763141.2023.2269418},
	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine which biomechanical variables measured during the baseball swing are associated with linear bat speed at ball contact (bat speed). Twenty collegiate baseball players hit a baseball from a tee into a net. Kinematics were recorded with a motion capture system sampling at 500 Hz and kinetics were measured by force plates under each foot sampling at 1000 Hz. Associations between bat speed, individual joint and segment kinematics, joint moments and ground reaction forces (GRF) were assessed using Pearson correlations and stepwise linear regression. Average bat speed was 30 ± 2 m/s. Lead foot peak vertical (159 ± 29\% BW, r = 0.622, P = 0.001), posterior (−57 ± 12\% BW, r = –0.574, P = 0.008) and resultant (170 ± 30\% BW, r = 0.662, P = 0.001) GRF were all correlated with bat speed. No combination of factors strengthened the relationship to bat speed beyond these individual variables. These results illustrate the role of the lead leg in generating and transferring ground reaction forces through the kinetic chain in order to accelerate the bat. Training to improve bat speed should include both general lower extremity strengthening exercises and sport-specific hitting drills to improve lower extremity force production following lead foot contact.},
