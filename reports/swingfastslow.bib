	abstract = {What is the optimal rate of passing in professional football? We derive a simple model of playcalling efficiency in the NFL. Efficiency is highest when the play comes as a surprise and falls when a more expected play is called. That is, playcalling efficiency is determined by a usage curve. We use an instrumental variables strategy to identify these usage curves on early downs---estimating the effect of passing, expected passing, and their interaction on per-play efficiency. We propose two new instruments, the first of which is based on fumbles lost. More specifically, we argue that conditional on total cumulative fumbles by each team, cumulative fumbles lost serves as a valid instrument in each of these cases. The second exploits documented negative autocorrelation in playcalling: the play after a pass tends to be a rush, and vice versa. Using 15 years of play-by-play data, we use this strategy to estimate linear usage curves, from which we recover the optimal early-down passing rate. On first and second down, coaches have their quarterbacks drop back to pass about 51.7\% of the time, whereas the optimal rate is around 59.1\%. These results imply coaches deviate from the optimal pass rate, overestimating the value of surprise.},

	volume = {233},
	doi = {10.1177/1754337119835682},
	abstract = {In baseball and softball, batted-ball velocities depend strongly on bat speed prior to contact. The purpose of this study was to characterize the sensitivity of hit. ball speed to swing speed models. A pitching machine was used to project balls at varying speeds considered to be age appropriate for female fastpitch softball batters ranging from 9 to 24 years of age. Participants swung bats of varying moment of inertia and high-speed video was used to measure bat and ball kinematics for each hit. Several power law swing speed models were compared, including a generic model for all participants, age-specific models and participant-specific models. In addition, an exponential Gaussian process regression model was used. Estimates of batted-ball speeds were obtained by coupling the swing speed models to a model of the bat–ball collision. The root mean square error of model estimates ranged from 2.3 to 5.0 rad/s for swing speed models and 3.6 to 8.5 m/s for batted-ball speed estimates. The Gaussian process regression model performance was similar to the participant-specific models (swing speed root mean square error = 2.4 rad/s; batted-ball speed root mean square error = 3.7 m/s). The correlation of the Gaussian process regression model with field measurements was surprising given the limited number of inputs, which warrants further investigation. Agreement between all power law models and field measurements improved when the bat moment of inertia about its instantaneous center of rotation (rather than about the knob) was considered. This information will be of use to players and coaches to improve batting performance and bat selection.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine which biomechanical variables measured during the baseball swing are associated with linear bat speed at ball contact (bat speed). Twenty collegiate baseball players hit a baseball from a tee into a net. Kinematics were recorded with a motion capture system sampling at 500 Hz and kinetics were measured by force plates under each foot sampling at 1000 Hz. Associations between bat speed, individual joint and segment kinematics, joint moments and ground reaction forces (GRF) were assessed using Pearson correlations and stepwise linear regression. Average bat speed was 30 ± 2 m/s. Lead foot peak vertical (159 ± 29\% BW, r = 0.622, P = 0.001), posterior (−57 ± 12\% BW, r = –0.574, P = 0.008) and resultant (170 ± 30\% BW, r = 0.662, P = 0.001) GRF were all correlated with bat speed. No combination of factors strengthened the relationship to bat speed beyond these individual variables. These results illustrate the role of the lead leg in generating and transferring ground reaction forces through the kinetic chain in order to accelerate the bat. Training to improve bat speed should include both general lower extremity strengthening exercises and sport-specific hitting drills to improve lower extremity force production following lead foot contact.},

Based on approximately 2.2 million pitches taken from the 2013, 2014, and 2015 MLB seasons, the quality of a particular pitch is evaluated as the expected number of bases conceded. Quality is expressed as a function of various covariates including pitch count, pitch location, pitch type, and pitch speed. The estimation of the pitch quality is obtained through the use of random forest methodology to accommodate the inherent complexity of the relationship between pitch quality and the associated covariates. With the fitted model, various applications are considered which provide new insights on pitching and batting.},
